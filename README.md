# Fake_news_classifier
This is another implementation of TF-IDF for binary classification. Just playing around with some Kaggle datasets, and in this case I found an interesting "Fake news" Dataset.

# dataset used
https://www.kaggle.com/ruchi798/source-based-news-classification

# outcome
Tested handful of classification algorithms and ended up sticking with Knearestneighbor.
Knearestneighbor yields an average of 98% accuracy & 98% AUC.

# TODO
need more data to create a better classifier. The models are biased towards the URL data field.
